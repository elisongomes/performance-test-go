# Performance Test Fibonacci

When an application is not scaling, we soon think of the need to increase the infrastructure, change the database or even the technology used, claiming that it is not performing. But the real problem most of the time can be in the code!

This repository contains the source codes used in the article "[My application doesn't scale, now what?](https://blog.elisongomes.com/my-application-doesnt-scale-now-what-4cf089c91375)", where I show how details make all the difference when creating a good algorithm.
